# TidyTuesday
A repository for my [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) mini-projects!

## What is it?
Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in R where users explore a new dataset each week and share their findings on 
Twitter with [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?lang=en). This repository is where I'll put my projects 
for it. :chart_with_upwards_trend:
