# TidyTuesday
A repository for my [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) mini-projects!

## What is it?
Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in R where users explore a new dataset each week and share their findings through data visualizations on Twitter with [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?lang=en). This repository is where I'll put my projects for it. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Past visualizations

### Crop Yield in Mexico
I looked at the [data for global crop yield](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/readme.md) and made a graph representing different crop yields in Mexico over time.

Also, nothing really special about wheat, just wanted to highlight one of the lines as practice.
